library(comics)
```

## Motivation

I'm bored, and you deserve a break from data science.

## XKCD

You can plot a random XKCD into your plots window:

```{r}
xkcd()
```

If you don't want the alt-text, I won't judge either:

```{r}
xkcd(print_alt = FALSE)
```


Or a specific one:

```{r}
xkcd(88)
```
